[\fI\,OPTION\/\fR]...
.SH DESCRIPTION
RNA2Dfold 2.6.4
.PP
Compute MFE structure, partition function and representative sample structures
of k,l neighborhoods
.PP
The program partitions the secondary structure space into (basepair)distance
classes according to two fixed reference structures. It expects a sequence and
two secondary structures in dot\-bracket notation as its inputs. For each
distance class, the MFE representative, Boltzmann probabilities and Gibbs free
energy is computed. Additionally, a stochastic backtracking routine allows one
to produce samples of representative suboptimal secondary structures from each
partition

estimate for the ensemble free energy (used to
avoid overflows).

.TP
\fB\-P\fR, \fB\-\-paramFile\fR=\fI\,paramfile\/\fR
Read energy parameters from paramfile, instead
of using the default parameter set.
.IP
Different sets of energy parameters for RNA and DNA should accompany your
distribution.
See the RNAlib documentation for details on the file format. The placeholder
file name 'DNA' can be used to load DNA parameters without the need to
actually specify any input file.

hairpins.

multi\-loops
.IP
(possible values="0", "2" default=`2')
.IP
With \fB\-d2\fR dangling energies will be added for the bases adjacent to a helix on
both sides in any case. The option \fB\-d0\fR ignores dangling ends altogether
(mostly for debugging).

Set the average backbone length for looped
regions in units of Angstrom.
.IP
