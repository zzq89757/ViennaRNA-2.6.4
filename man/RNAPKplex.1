.SH SYNOPSIS
.B RNAPKplex
[\fI\,OPTION\/\fR]...
.SH DESCRIPTION
RNAPKplex 2.6.4
.PP
predicts RNA secondary structures including pseudoknots
.PP
Computes RNA secondary structures by first making two sequence intervals
accessible and unpaired using the algorithm of RNAplfold and then calculating
the energy of the interaction of those two intervals. The algorithm uses
O(n^2*w^4) CPU time and O(n*w^2) memory space.
The algorithm furthermore always considers dangle=2 model.
.PP

It  also  produces a PostScript file with a plot of the pseudoknot-free
secondary structure graph, in which the bases  forming  the  pseuodknot
are marked red.

Sequences are read in a simple text format where each sequence occupies
a single line. Each sequence may be preceded by a line of the form
.nf
.ft CW
> name
.ft
.fi
to assign a name to the sequence. If a name is given in the input, the
 PostScript file "name.ps" is produced for the structure graph.  Other-
wise  the  file  name defaults to PKplex.ps. Existing files of the same
name will be overwritten.
The input format is similar to fasta except that  even  long  sequences
may  not  be  interrupted  by  line  breaks,  and  the header lines are
optional.  The program will continue to read new sequences until a line
consisting  of  the  single  character @ or an end of file condition is
encountered.

\fB\-h\fR, \fB\-\-help\fR
Print help and exit
.TP
\fB\-\-detailed\-help\fR
Print help, including all details and hidden
options, and exit
.TP
\fB\-\-full\-help\fR
Print help, including hidden options, and exit
.TP
\fB\-V\fR, \fB\-\-version\fR
Print version and exit
.TP
\fB\-v\fR, \fB\-\-verbose\fR
Be verbose.
.IP
(default=off)
.SS "I/O Options:"
.IP
Command line options for input and output (pre\-)processing
.TP
\fB\-\-noconv\fR
Do not automatically substitute nucleotide "T"
with "U".
.IP
(default=off)
.SS "Algorithms:"
.IP
Select additional algorithms which should be included in the calculations.
.TP
\fB\-c\fR, \fB\-\-cutoff\fR=\fI\,FLOAT\/\fR
Report only base pairs with an average
probability > cutoff in the dot plot.
.IP
(default=`0.01')
.TP
\fB\-e\fR, \fB\-\-energyCutoff\fR=\fI\,DOUBLE\/\fR
Energy cutoff or pseudoknot initiation cost.
Minimum energy gain of a pseudoknot
interaction for it to be returned. Pseudoknots
with smaller energy gains are rejected.
.IP
(default=`\-8.10')
.TP
\fB\-s\fR, \fB\-\-subopts\fR=\fI\,DOUBLE\/\fR
print suboptimal structures whose energy
difference of the pseudoknot to the optimum
pseudoknot is smaller than the given value.
.IP
(default=`0.0')
.IP
NOTE: The final energy of a structure is calculated as the sum of the
pseudoknot interaction energy, the penalty for initiating a  pseudoknot and
the energy of the pseudoknot\-free part of the structure. The \fB\-s\fR option only
takes the pseudoknot interaction energy into account, so the final energy
differences may be bigger than the specified value (default=0.).
.SS "Energy Parameters:"
.IP
Energy parameter sets can be adapted or loaded from user\-provided input files
.TP
\fB\-T\fR, \fB\-\-temp\fR=\fI\,DOUBLE\/\fR
Rescale energy parameters to a temperature of
temp C. Default is 37C.
.IP
(default=`37.0')
.TP
\fB\-P\fR, \fB\-\-paramFile\fR=\fI\,paramfile\/\fR
Read energy parameters from paramfile, instead
of using the default parameter set.
.IP
Different sets of energy parameters for RNA and DNA should accompany your
distribution.
See the RNAlib documentation for details on the file format. The placeholder
file name 'DNA' can be used to load DNA parameters without the need to
actually specify any input file.
.TP
\fB\-4\fR, \fB\-\-noTetra\fR
Do not include special tabulated stabilizing
energies for tri\-, tetra\- and hexaloop
hairpins.
.IP
(default=off)
.IP
Mostly for testing.
.TP
\fB\-\-salt\fR=\fI\,DOUBLE\/\fR
Set salt concentration in molar (M). Default is
1.021M.
.SS "Model Details:"
.IP
Tweak the energy model and pairing rules additionally using the following
parameters
.TP
\fB\-\-noLP\fR
Produce structures without lonely pairs (helices
of length 1).
.IP
(default=off)
.IP
For partition function folding this only disallows pairs that can only occur
isolated. Other pairs may still occasionally occur as helices of length 1.
.TP
\fB\-\-noGU\fR
Do not allow GU pairs.
.IP
(default=off)
.TP
\fB\-\-noClosingGU\fR
Do not allow GU pairs at the end of helices.
.IP
(default=off)
.TP
\fB\-\-nsp\fR=\fI\,STRING\/\fR
Allow other pairs in addition to the usual
AU,GC,and GU pairs.
.IP
Its argument is a comma separated list of additionally allowed pairs. If the
first character is a "\-" then AB will imply that AB and BA are allowed
pairs, e.g. \fB\-\-nsp=\fR"\-GA"  will allow GA and AG pairs. Nonstandard pairs are
given 0 stacking energy.
.TP
\fB\-\-helical\-rise\fR=\fI\,FLOAT\/\fR
Set the helical rise of the helix in units of
Angstrom.
.IP
(default=`2.8')
.IP
Use with caution! This value will be re\-set automatically to 3.4 in case DNA
parameters are loaded via \fB\-P\fR DNA and no further value is provided.
.TP
\fB\-\-backbone\-length\fR=\fI\,FLOAT\/\fR
Set the average backbone length for looped
regions in units of Angstrom.
.IP
(default=`6.0')
.IP
Use with caution! This value will be re\-set automatically to 6.76 in case DNA
parameters are loaded via \fB\-P\fR DNA and no further value is provided.
