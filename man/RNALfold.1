.SH SYNOPSIS
.B RNALfold
[\fI\,OPTION\/\fR]...
.SH DESCRIPTION
RNALfold 2.6.4
.PP
calculate locally stable secondary structures of RNAs
.PP
Compute locally stable RNA secondary structure with a maximal base pair span.
For a sequence of length n and a base pair span of L the algorithm uses only
O(n+L*L) memory and O(n*L*L) CPU time. Thus it is practical to "scan" very
large genomes for short RNA structures.
Output consists of a list of secondary structure components of size <= L, one
entry per line. Each output line contains the predicted local structure its
energy in kcal/mol and the starting position of the local structure.

.IP
(default=off)
.SS "I/O Options:"
.IP
Command line options for input and output (pre\-)processing
.TP
\fB\-i\fR, \fB\-\-infile\fR=\fI\,filename\/\fR
Read a file instead of reading from stdin
.IP
The default behavior of RNALfold is to read input from stdin. Using this
parameter the user can specify an input file name where data is read from.
.TP
\fB\-o\fR, \fB\-\-outfile\fR[=\fI\,filename\/\fR]
Print output to file instead of stdout.
.IP
This option may be used to write all output to output files rather than
printing to stdout. The number of output files created for batch input
(multiple sequences) depends on three conditions: (i) In case an optional
filename is given as parameter argument, a single file with the specified
filename will be written into. If the optional argument is omitted, (ii)
FASTA input or an active \fB\-\-auto\-id\fR switch will write to multiple files that
follow the naming scheme "prefix.lfold". Here, "prefix" is taken from the
sequence id as specified in the FASTA header. Lastly, (iii) single\-line
sequence input without FASTA header will be written to a single file
"RNALfold_output.lfold". In case an output file already exists, any output
of the program will be appended to it.
Since the filename argument is optional, it must immediately follow the short
option flag to not be mistaken as new parameter to the program. For instance
\e'\-ornafold.out\e' will write to a file "rnafold.out".
Note: Any special characters in the filename will be replaced by the filename
delimiter, hence there is no way to pass an entire directory path through
this option yet. (See also the "\-\-filename\-delim" parameter)
.TP
\fB\-\-noconv\fR
Do not automatically substitute nucleotide
"T" with "U".
.IP
(default=off)
.TP
\fB\-\-auto\-id\fR
Automatically generate an ID for each sequence.
(default=off)
.IP
The default mode of RNALfold is to automatically determine an ID from the
input sequence data if the input file format allows to do that. Sequence IDs
are usually given in the FASTA header of input sequences. If this flag is
active, RNALfold ignores any IDs retrieved from the input and automatically
generates an ID for each sequence. This ID consists of a prefix and an
increasing number. This flag can also be used to add a FASTA header to the
output even if the input has none.
.TP
\fB\-\-id\-prefix\fR=\fI\,STRING\/\fR
Prefix for automatically generated IDs (as used
in output file names).
.IP
(default=`sequence')
.IP
If this parameter is set, each sequence will be prefixed with the provided
string. Hence, the output files will obey the following naming scheme:
"prefix_xxxx.lfold" where xxxx is the sequence number. Note: Setting this
parameter implies \fB\-\-auto\-id\fR.
.TP
\fB\-\-id\-delim\fR=\fI\,CHAR\/\fR
Change the delimiter between prefix and
increasing number for automatically generated
IDs (as used in output file names).
.IP
(default=`_')
.IP
This parameter can be used to change the default delimiter "_" between the
prefix string and the increasing number for automatically generated ID.
.TP
\fB\-\-id\-digits\fR=\fI\,INT\/\fR
Specify the number of digits of the counter in
automatically generated alignment IDs.
.IP
(default=`4')
.IP
When alignments IDs are automatically generated, they receive an increasing
number, starting with 1. This number will always be left\-padded by leading
zeros, such that the number takes up a certain width. Using this parameter,
the width can be specified to the users need. We allow numbers in the range
[1:18]. This option implies \fB\-\-auto\-id\fR.
.TP
\fB\-\-id\-start\fR=\fI\,LONG\/\fR
Specify the first number in automatically
generated IDs.
.IP
(default=`1')
.IP
When sequence IDs are automatically generated, they receive an increasing
number, usually starting with 1. Using this parameter, the first number can
be specified to the users requirements. Note: negative numbers are not
allowed.
Note: Setting this parameter implies to ignore any IDs retrieved from the
input data, i.e. it activates the \fB\-\-auto\-id\fR flag.
.TP
\fB\-\-filename\-delim\fR=\fI\,CHAR\/\fR
Change the delimiting character used in
sanitized filenames.
.IP
(default=`ID\-delimiter')
.IP
This parameter can be used to change the delimiting character used while
sanitizing filenames, i.e. replacing invalid characters. Note, that the
default delimiter ALWAYS is the first character of the "ID delimiter" as
supplied through the \fB\-\-id\-delim\fR option. If the delimiter is a whitespace
character or empty, invalid characters will be simply removed rather than
substituted. Currently, we regard the following characters as illegal for use
in filenames: backslash '\e', slash '/', question mark '?', percent sign '%',
asterisk '*', colon ':', pipe symbol '|', double quote '"', triangular
brackets '<' and '>'.
.TP
\fB\-\-filename\-full\fR
Use full FASTA header to create filenames.
(default=off)
.IP
This parameter can be used to deactivate the default behavior of limiting
output filenames to the first word of the sequence ID. Consider the following
example: An input with FASTA header '>NM_0001 Homo Sapiens some gene' usually
produces output files with the prefix "NM_0001" without the additional data
available in the FASTA header, e.g. "NM_0001_ss.ps" for secondary structure
plots. With this flag set, no truncation of the output filenames is done,
i.e. output filenames receive the full FASTA header data as prefixes. Note,
however, that invalid characters (such as whitespace) will be substituted by
a delimiting character or simply removed, (see also the parameter option
\fB\-\-filename\-delim\fR).
.SS "Algorithms:"
.IP
Select additional algorithms which should be included in the calculations.
The Minimum free energy (MFE) and a structure representative are calculated
in any case.
.TP
\fB\-L\fR, \fB\-\-span\fR=\fI\,INT\/\fR
Set the maximum distance between any two
pairing nucleotides.
.IP
(default=`150')
.IP
This option specifies the window length L and therefore the upper limit for
the distance between the bases i and j of any pair (i, j), i.e. (j \- i + 1)
<= L.
.TP
\fB\-z\fR, \fB\-\-zscore\fR[=\fI\,DOUBLE\/\fR]
Limit the output to predictions with a Z\-score
below a threshold.
.IP
(default=`\-2')
.IP
This option activates z\-score regression using a trained SVM. Any predicted
structure that exceeds the specified threshold will be ommited from the
output.
Since the Z\-score threshold is given as a negative number, it must
immediately preceed the short option to not be mistaken as a separate
argument, e.g. \fB\-z\-2\fR.9 sets the threshold to a value of \fB\-2\fR.9
.TP
\fB\-\-zscore\-pre\-filter\fR
Apply the z\-score filtering in the forward
recursions.
.IP
(default=off)
.IP
The default mode of z\-score filtering considers the entire structure space to
decide whether or not a locally optimal structure at any position i is
reported or not. When using this post\-filtering step, however, alternative
locally optimal structures
.IP
starting at i with higher energy but lower z\-score can be easily missed. The
.IP
pre\-filter
.IP
option restricts the structure space already in the forward recursions, such
.IP
that
.IP
only optimal solution among those candidates that satisfy the z\-score
.IP
threshold are considered. Therefore, good results according to the z\-score
threshold criterion are less likely to be superseded by results with better
energy but worse z\-score. Note, that activating this switch results in higher
computation time which scales linear in the window length.
.TP
\fB\-\-zscore\-report\-subsumed\fR
Report subsumed structures if their z\-score is
less than that of the enclosing structure.
.IP
(default=off)
.IP
In default mode, RNALfold only reports locally optimal structures if they are
no constituents of another, larger structure with less free energy. In
z\-score mode, however, such a larger structure may have a higher z\-score,
thus may be less informative than the smaller substructure. Using this switch
activates reporting both, the smaller and the larger structure if the z\-score
of the smaller is lower than that of the larger.
.TP
\fB\-b\fR, \fB\-\-backtrack\-global\fR
Backtrack a global MFE structure.
(default=off)
.IP
Instead of just reporting the locally stable secondary structure a global MFE
structure can be constructed that only consists of locally optimal
substructures. This switch activates a post\-processing step that takes the
locally optimal structures to generate the global MFE structure which
constitutes the MFE value reported in the last line. The respective global
MFE structure is printed just after the inut sequence part on the last line,
preceding the global MFE score.
Note, that this option implies \fB\-o\fR/\-\-outfile since the locally optimal
structures must be read after the regular prediction step! Also note, that
using this option in combination with \fB\-z\fR/\-\-zscore implies \fB\-\-zscore\-pre\-filter\fR
to ensure proper construction of the global MFE structure!
.TP
\fB\-g\fR, \fB\-\-gquad\fR
Incoorporate G\-Quadruplex formation into the
structure prediction algorithm.
.IP
(default=off)
.SS "Structure Constraints:"
.IP
Command line options to interact with the structure constraints feature of
this program
.TP
\fB\-\-shape\fR=\fI\,filename\/\fR
Use SHAPE reactivity data to guide structure
predictions.
.TP
\fB\-\-shapeMethod\fR=\fI\,method\/\fR
Select SHAPE reactivity data incorporation
strategy.
.IP
(default=`D')
.IP
The following methods can be used to convert SHAPE reactivities into pseudo
energy contributions.
.IP
\&'D': Convert by using the linear equation according to Deigan et al 2009.
.IP
Derived pseudo energy terms will be applied for every nucleotide involved in
a stacked pair. This method is recognized by a capital 'D' in the provided
parameter, i.e.: \fB\-\-shapeMethod=\fR"D" is the default setting. The slope 'm'
and the intercept 'b' can be set to a non\-default value if necessary,
otherwise m=1.8 and b=\-0.6. To alter these parameters, e.g. m=1.9 and b=\-0.7,
use a parameter string like this: \fB\-\-shapeMethod=\fR"Dm1.9b\-0.7". You may also
provide only one of the two parameters like: \fB\-\-shapeMethod=\fR"Dm1.9" or
\fB\-\-shapeMethod=\fR"Db\-0.7".
.IP
\&'Z': Convert SHAPE reactivities to pseudo energies according to Zarringhalam
.IP
et al 2012. SHAPE reactivities will be converted to pairing probabilities by
using linear mapping. Aberration from the observed pairing probabilities will
be penalized during the folding recursion. The magnitude of the penalties can
affected by adjusting the factor beta (e.g. \fB\-\-shapeMethod=\fR"Zb0.8").
.IP
\&'W': Apply a given vector of perturbation energies to unpaired nucleotides
.IP
according to Washietl et al 2012. Perturbation vectors can be calculated by
using RNApvmin.
.TP
\fB\-\-shapeConversion\fR=\fI\,method\/\fR
Select method for SHAPE reactivity conversion.
.IP
(default=`O')
.IP
This parameter is useful when dealing with the SHAPE incorporation according
to Zarringhalam et al. The following methods can be used to convert SHAPE
reactivities into the probability for a certain nucleotide to be unpaired.
.IP
\&'M': Use linear mapping according to Zarringhalam et al.
\&'C': Use a cutoff\-approach to divide into paired and unpaired nucleotides
(e.g. "C0.25")
\&'S': Skip the normalizing step since the input data already represents
probabilities for being unpaired rather than raw reactivity values
\&'L': Use a linear model to convert the reactivity into a probability for
being unpaired (e.g. "Ls0.68i0.2" to use a slope of 0.68 and an intercept
of 0.2)
\&'O': Use a linear model to convert the log of the reactivity into a
probability for being unpaired (e.g. "Os1.6i\-2.29" to use a slope of 1.6
and an intercept of \fB\-2\fR.29)
.TP
\fB\-\-commands\fR=\fI\,filename\/\fR
Read additional commands from file
.IP
Commands include hard and soft constraints, but also structure motifs in
hairpin and interior loops that need to be treeted differently. Furthermore,
commands can be set for unstructured and structured domains.
.SS "Energy Parameters:"
.IP
Energy parameter sets can be adapted or loaded from user\-provided input files
.TP
\fB\-T\fR, \fB\-\-temp\fR=\fI\,DOUBLE\/\fR
Rescale energy parameters to a temperature of
temp C. Default is 37C.
.IP
(default=`37.0')
.TP
\fB\-P\fR, \fB\-\-paramFile\fR=\fI\,paramfile\/\fR
Read energy parameters from paramfile, instead
of using the default parameter set.
.IP
Different sets of energy parameters for RNA and DNA should accompany your
distribution.
See the RNAlib documentation for details on the file format. The placeholder
file name 'DNA' can be used to load DNA parameters without the need to
actually specify any input file.
.TP
\fB\-4\fR, \fB\-\-noTetra\fR
Do not include special tabulated stabilizing
energies for tri\-, tetra\- and hexaloop
hairpins.
.IP
(default=off)
.IP
Mostly for testing.
.TP
\fB\-\-salt\fR=\fI\,DOUBLE\/\fR
Set salt concentration in molar (M). Default is
1.021M.
.TP
\fB\-m\fR, \fB\-\-modifications\fR[=\fI\,STRING\/\fR]
Allow for modified bases within the RNA
sequence string.
.IP
(default=`7I6P9D')
.IP
Treat modified bases within the RNA sequence differently, i.e. use
corresponding energy corrections and/or pairing partner rules if available.
For that, the modified bases in the input sequence must be marked by their
corresponding one\-letter code. If no additional arguments are supplied, all
available corrections are performed. Otherwise, the user may limit the
modifications to a particular subset of modifications, resp. one\-letter
codes, e.g. \fB\-mP6\fR will only correct for pseudouridine and m6A bases.
.IP
Currently supported one\-letter codes and energy corrections are:
.IP
\&'7': 7\-deaza\-adenonsine (7DA)
.IP
\&'I': Inosine
.IP
\&'6': N6\-methyladenosine (m6A)
.IP
\&'P': Pseudouridine
.IP
\&'9': Purine (a.k.a. nebularine)
.IP
\&'D': Dihydrouridine
.TP
\fB\-\-mod\-file\fR=\fI\,STRING\/\fR
Use additional modified base data from JSON
file.
.SS "Model Details:"
.IP
Tweak the energy model and pairing rules additionally using the following
parameters
.TP
\fB\-d\fR, \fB\-\-dangles\fR=\fI\,INT\/\fR
How to treat "dangling end" energies for
bases adjacent to helices in free ends and
multi\-loops.
.IP
(default=`2')
.IP
With \fB\-d1\fR only unpaired bases can participate in at most one dangling end.
With \fB\-d2\fR this check is ignored, dangling energies will be added for the bases
adjacent to a helix on both sides in any case; this is the default for mfe
and partition function folding (\fB\-p\fR).
The option \fB\-d0\fR ignores dangling ends altogether (mostly for debugging).
With \fB\-d3\fR mfe folding will allow coaxial stacking of adjacent helices in
multi\-loops. At the moment the implementation will not allow coaxial stacking
of the two interior pairs in a loop of degree 3 and works only for mfe
folding.
.IP
Note that with \fB\-d1\fR and \fB\-d3\fR only the MFE computations will be using this
setting while partition function uses \fB\-d2\fR setting, i.e. dangling ends will be
treated differently.
.TP
\fB\-\-noLP\fR
Produce structures without lonely pairs
(helices of length 1).
.IP
(default=off)
.IP
For partition function folding this only disallows pairs that can only occur
isolated. Other pairs may still occasionally occur as helices of length 1.
.TP
\fB\-\-noGU\fR
Do not allow GU pairs.
.IP
(default=off)
.TP
\fB\-\-noClosingGU\fR
Do not allow GU pairs at the end of helices.
.IP
(default=off)
.TP
\fB\-\-nsp\fR=\fI\,STRING\/\fR
Allow other pairs in addition to the usual
AU,GC,and GU pairs.
.IP
Its argument is a comma separated list of additionally allowed pairs. If the
first character is a "\-" then AB will imply that AB and BA are allowed
pairs, e.g. \fB\-\-nsp=\fR"\-GA"  will allow GA and AG pairs. Nonstandard pairs are
given 0 stacking energy.
.TP
\fB\-e\fR, \fB\-\-energyModel\fR=\fI\,INT\/\fR
Set energy model.
.IP
Rarely used option to fold sequences from the artificial ABCD... alphabet,
where A pairs B, C\-D etc.  Use the energy parameters for GC (\fB\-e\fR 1) or AU (\fB\-e\fR
2) pairs.
.TP
\fB\-\-helical\-rise\fR=\fI\,FLOAT\/\fR
Set the helical rise of the helix in units of
Angstrom.
.IP
(default=`2.8')
.IP
Use with caution! This value will be re\-set automatically to 3.4 in case DNA
parameters are loaded via \fB\-P\fR DNA and no further value is provided.
.TP
\fB\-\-backbone\-length\fR=\fI\,FLOAT\/\fR
Set the average backbone length for looped
regions in units of Angstrom.
.IP
(default=`6.0')
.IP
Use with caution! This value will be re\-set automatically to 6.76 in case DNA
parameters are loaded via \fB\-P\fR DNA and no further value is provided.
