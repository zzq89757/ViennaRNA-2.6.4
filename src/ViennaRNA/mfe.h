/**
 *  @brief Compute minimum free energy and an appropriate secondary
 *  structure of an RNA sequence, or RNA sequence alignment
 *
 *  Depending on the type of the provided #vrna_fold_compound_t, this function
 *  predicts the MFE for a single sequence (or connected component of multiple
 *  sequences), or an averaged MFE for a sequence alignment.
 *  If backtracking is activated, it also constructs the corresponding secondary
 *  structure, or consensus structure.
 *  Therefore, the second parameter, @a structure, has to point to an allocated
 *  block of memory with a size of at least @f$\mathrm{strlen}(\mathrm{sequence})+1@f$ to
 *  store the backtracked MFE structure. (For consensus structures, this is the length of
 *  the alignment + 1. If @p NULL is passed, no backtracking will be performed.
 *
 *  @note This function is polymorphic. It accepts #vrna_fold_compound_t of type
 *        #VRNA_FC_TYPE_SINGLE, and #VRNA_FC_TYPE_COMPARATIVE.
 *
 *  @see #vrna_fold_compound_t, vrna_fold_compound(), vrna_fold(), vrna_circfold(),
