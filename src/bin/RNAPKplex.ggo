description "Computes RNA secondary structures by first making two sequence intervals accessible and unpaired using\
 the algorithm of RNAplfold and then calculating the energy of the interaction of those two intervals. The algorithm\
 uses O(n^2*w^4) CPU time and O(n*w^2) memory space.\nThe algorithm furthermore always considers dangle=2 model.\n"

option  "verbose" v
"Be verbose.\n\n"

off


section "I/O Options"
sectiondesc="Command line options for input and output (pre-)processing\n\n"

option  "noconv"  -
"Do not automatically substitute nucleotide \"T\" with \"U\".\n\n"
flag
off


section "Algorithms"
sectiondesc="Select additional algorithms which should be included in the calculations.\n\n"

option  "cutoff"  c
"Report only base pairs with an average probability > cutoff in the dot plot.\n\n"
float
default="0.01"
optional

option  "energyCutoff" e
"Energy cutoff or pseudoknot initiation cost. Minimum energy gain of a pseudoknot\
 interaction for it to be returned. Pseudoknots with smaller energy gains are\
 rejected.\n\n"
double
default="-8.10"
optional

option "subopts" s
"print suboptimal structures whose energy difference of the pseudoknot to the optimum pseudoknot is smaller than the given value.\n"
details="NOTE: The final energy of a structure is calculated as the sum\
 of the pseudoknot interaction energy, the penalty for initiating\
 a  pseudoknot and the energy of the pseudoknot-free part of the\
 structure. The -s option only takes the pseudoknot interaction\
 energy into account, so the final energy differences may be bigger\
 than the specified value (default=0.).\n\n"
double
default="0.0"
optional


section "Energy Parameters"
sectiondesc="Energy parameter sets can be adapted or loaded from user-provided input files\n\n"

option  "temp"  T
"Rescale energy parameters to a temperature of temp C. Default is 37C.\n\n"
double
default="37.0"
optional

option  "paramFile" P
"Read energy parameters from paramfile, instead of using the default parameter set.\n"
details="Different sets of energy parameters for RNA and DNA should accompany your distribution.\nSee the\
 RNAlib documentation for details on the file format. The placeholder file name 'DNA' can be used\
 to load DNA parameters without the need to actually specify any input file.\n\n"

option  "noTetra" 4
"Do not include special tabulated stabilizing energies for tri-, tetra- and hexaloop hairpins.\n"
details="Mostly for testing.\n\n"

option  "salt" -
"Set salt concentration in molar (M). Default is 1.021M.\n\n"

optional


section "Model Details"
sectiondesc="Tweak the energy model and pairing rules additionally using the following parameters\n\n"

option  "noLP"  -
"Produce structures without lonely pairs (helices of length 1).\n"
details="For partition function folding this only disallows pairs that can only occur isolated. Other\
 pairs may still occasionally occur as helices of length 1.\n\n"

option  "nsp" -
"Allow other pairs in addition to the usual AU,GC,and GU pairs.\n"
details="Its argument is a comma separated list of additionally allowed pairs. If the\
 first character is a \"-\" then AB will imply that AB and BA are allowed pairs, e.g.\
 --nsp=\"-GA\"  will allow GA and AG pairs. Nonstandard pairs are given 0 stacking\
 energy.\n\n"

option  "helical-rise"  -
"Set the helical rise of the helix in units of Angstrom.\n"
