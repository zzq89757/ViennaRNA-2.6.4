DESCRIPTION
-----------

RNAplex 2.6.4

Find targets of a query RNA

reads two RNA sequences from stdin or <filename> and computes optimal and
suboptimal secondary structures for their hybridization. The calculation is
simplified by allowing only inter-molecular base pairs. Accessibility effects
can be estimated by RNAplex if a RNAplfold accessibility profile is provided.
The computed optimal and suboptimal structure are written to stdout, one
structure per line. Each line consist of: The structure in dot bracket format
with a "&" separating the two strands. The range of the structure in the two
sequences in the format  "from,to : from,to"; the energy of duplex structure
in kcal/mol.
The format is especially useful for computing the hybrid structure between a
small probe sequence and a long target sequence.

I/O Options:
^^^^^^^^^^^^



    Command line options for input and output (pre-)processing

.. option:: -q, --query=STRING

    File containing the query sequence.


    Input sequences can be given piped to RNAplex or given in a query file with
    the :option:`-q` option. Note that the :option:`-q` option implies that the :option:`-t` option is also
    used

.. option:: -t, --target=STRING

    File containing the target sequence.


    Input sequences can be given piped to RNAplex or given in a target file with
    the :option:`-t` option. Note that the :option:`-t` option implies that the :option:`-q` option is also
    used

.. option:: -a, --accessibility-dir=STRING

    Location of the accessibility profiles.


    This option switches the accessibility modes on and indicates in which
    directory accessibility profiles as generated by RNAplfold can be found

.. option:: -b, --binary

    Allow the reading and parsing of memory dumped opening energy file


    *(default=off)*


    The :option:`-b` option allows one to read and process opening energy files which are
    saved in binary format


    This can reduce by a factor of 500x-1000x the time needed to process those


    files. RNAplex recognizes the corresponding opening energy files by looking
    for files named after the sequence and containing the suffix _openen_bin.
    Please look at the man page of RNAplfold if you need more information on how
    to produce binary opening energy files.

Algorithms:
^^^^^^^^^^^



    Options which alter the computing behaviour of RNAplex.

.. option:: -l, --interaction-length=INT

    Maximal length of an interaction *(default="40")*


    Maximal allowed length of an interaction

.. option:: -c, --extension-cost=INT

    Cost to add to each nucleotide in a duplex *(default="0")*


    Cost of extending a duplex by one nucleotide. Allows one to find compact
    duplexes, having few/small bulges or interior loops Only useful when no
    accessibility profiles are available. This option is disabled if
    accessibility profiles are used (:option:`-a` option)

.. option:: -p, --probe-mode

    Compute Tm for probes *(default=off)*


    Use this option if you want to compute the melting temperature of your probes

.. option:: -Q, --probe-concentration=DOUBLE

    Set the probe concentration for the Tm


    computation


    *(default="0.1")*

.. option:: -N, --na-concentration=DOUBLE Set the Na+ concentration for the Tm

    computation.


    *(default="1.0")*

.. option:: -M, --mg-concentration=DOUBLE Set the Mg2+ concentration for the Tm

    computation.


    *(default="1.0")*

.. option:: -K, --k-concentration=DOUBLE

    Set the K+ concentration for the Tm computation.


    *(default="1.0")*

.. option:: -U, --tris-concentration=DOUBLE

    Set the tris+ concentration for the Tm


    computation.


    *(default="1.0")*

.. option:: -f, --fast-folding=INT

    Speedup of the target search *(default="0")*


    This option allows one to decide if the backtracking has to be done (:option:`-f` 0, :option:`-f`
    2) or not (:option:`-f` 1). For :option:`-f` 0 the structure is computed based on the standard
    energy model. This is the slowest and most precise mode of RNAplex. With :option:`-f`
    2, the structure is computed based on the approximated plex model. If a lot
    of targets are returned this is can greatly improve the runtime of RNAplex.
    :option:`-f` 1 is the fastest mode, as no structure are recomputed

.. option:: -V, --scale-accessibility=DOUBLE

    Rescale all opening energy by a factor V


    *(default="1.0")*


    Scale-factor for the accessibility. If V is set to 1 then the scaling has no
    effect on the accessibility.

.. option:: -A, --alignment-mode

    Tells RNAplex to compute interactions based on alignments


    *(default=off)*


    If the A option is set RNAplex expects clustalw files as input for the :option:`-q` and
    :option:`-t` option.

.. option:: -k, --convert-to-bin

    If set, RNAplex will convert all opening energy file in a directory set by the :option:`-a` option into binary opening energy files


    *(default=off)*


    RNAplex can be used to convert existing text formatted opening energy files
    into binary formatted files. In this mode RNAplex does not compute
    interactions.

.. option:: -z, --duplex-distance=INT

    Distance between target 3' ends of two consecutive duplexes


    *(default="0")*


    Distance between the target 3'ends of two consecutive duplexes. Should be set
    to the maximal length of interaction to get good results


    Smaller z leads to larger overlaps between consecutive duplexes.

.. option:: -e, --energy-threshold=DOUBLE Minimal energy for a duplex to be returned

    *(default="-100000")*


    Energy threshold for a duplex to be returned. The threshold is set on the
    total energy of interaction, i.e. the hybridization energy corrected for
    opening energy if :option:`-a` is set or the energy corrected by :option:`-c`. If unset, only the
    mfe will be returned

.. option:: -L, --WindowLength=INT

    Tells how large the region around the target site should be for redrawing the alignment interaction


    *(default="1")*


    This option allows one to specify how large the region surrounding the target
    site should be set when generating the alignment figure of the interaction

Structure Constraints:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^



    Command line options to interact with the structure constraints feature of
    this program

.. option:: -C, --constraint

    Calculate structures subject to constraints. *(default=off)*


    The program reads first the sequence, then a string containing constraints on
    the structure for the query sequence encoded with the symbols:
    . (no constraint for this base)
    | (the corresponding base has to be paired)

Energy Parameters:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^



    Energy parameter sets can be adapted or loaded from user-provided input files

.. option:: -T, --temp=DOUBLE

    Rescale energy parameters to a temperature of temp C. Default is 37C.


    *(default="37.0")*

.. option:: -P, --paramFile=paramfile

    Read energy parameters from paramfile, instead of using the default parameter set.


    Different sets of energy parameters for RNA and DNA should accompany your
    distribution.
    See the RNAlib documentation for details on the file format. When passing the
    placeholder file name "DNA", DNA parameters are loaded without the need to
    actually specify any input file.

.. option:: -4, --noTetra

    Do not include special tabulated stabilizing energies for tri-, tetra- and hexaloop hairpins.


    *(default=off)*


    Mostly for testing.

.. option:: --salt=DOUBLE

    Set salt concentration in molar (M). Default is 1.021M.

.. option:: --saltInit=DOUBLE

    Provide salt correction for duplex initialization (in kcal/mol).

Model Details:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^



    Tweak the energy model and pairing rules additionally using the following
    parameters

.. option:: --helical-rise=FLOAT

    Set the helical rise of the helix in units of Angstrom.


    *(default="2.8")*


    Use with caution! This value will be re-set automatically to 3.4 in case DNA
    parameters are loaded via :option:`-P` DNA and no further value is provided.

.. option:: --backbone-length=FLOAT

    Set the average backbone length for looped regions in units of Angstrom.


    *(default="6.0")*


    Use with caution! This value will be re-set automatically to 6.76 in case DNA
    parameters are loaded via :option:`-P` DNA and no further value is provided.

Plotting:
^^^^^^^^^



    Command line options for changing the default behavior of structure layout
    and pairing probability plots

.. option:: -I, --produce-ps=STRING

    Draw an alignment annotated interaction from RNAplex.


    This option allows one to produce interaction figures in PS-format a la
    RNAalifold, where base-pair conservation is represented in color-coded
    format. In this mode no interaction are computed, but the :option:`-I` option indicates
    the location of the file containing interactions between two RNA
    (alignments/sequence) from a previous run. If the :option:`-A` option is not set a
    structure figure a la RNAfold with color-coded annotation of the
    accessibilities is returned
