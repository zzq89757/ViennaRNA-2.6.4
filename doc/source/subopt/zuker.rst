Suboptimal Structures sensu Zuker
=================================

The algorithm to compute optimal secondary structures that contain
a particular base pair has been published by :cite:t:`zuker:1989`
and is based on ideas for predicting structures for circular RNAs,
in particular viroids, as presented in :cite:t:`steger:1984`.
